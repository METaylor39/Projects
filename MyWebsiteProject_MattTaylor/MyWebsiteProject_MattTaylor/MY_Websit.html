	Hello, my name is Matthew Taylor,and this is my fourth semester at Bristol Community colledge. I'm currently pursuing a computer informations transfer, with the long term goal of earning a game development degree. I've been intrested in game development since high school, and have stated pursuing a degree in it since.
	<br>I mostly enroled in BCC for finacial reasons. I'd like to use the mass transfer schoolarships to avoid the ever cursed student debt. Still its a great school and I've met some great people here.<br>After BCC I plan on transfering to UMass Dartmouth, and after colledge join up with a game company and gain experiance. The dream is to be able to direct my own game; Either through a company, or indie means.<br>
	The main draw to game development to me is the ablity to create.</p>

	<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
	
	<p style= "font-size:2vw; text-align: center;">
	<p>Through the information on the sites I used, I concluded that I am a visual and kinetic learner; Though mostly kinetic.<br>This means I work best in "hands on" scenarios with alot of visual information(body language, diagrams, and written notes). </p>

	<tr>
	<td>Kinetic</td>
	<td><p1>First I will attempt to move my upper body around as much as possible, and tap my feet when working on any projects. This will help mne to stay focused on the work in front of me and not have my eyes wander.
	I also will save most of my textbooks and reading for the gym. I'll read paragraphs in between sets, a stratagy I've already used that has worked well for me in the past.</p1></td>
	</tr>
	<td>Visual</td>
	<td><p1>Videos,videos,videos. Preferably I'd learn face to face, but given the circumstances videos will be the best way for me to learn. I'll also utalize written notes, regardless of how often I go back to them, It will assist me in absorbing thge information in the moment.</p1></td>

	<h3>Time Management</h3>
<br>
	<li><a href="https://www.timemanagementhelp.com/college.htm">Time Management for College Students</a></li>
<br>
	<p>Time management has always been a challenge for me, and so this article will hopefully help with that problem. <br> The first stratagey that I'd like to implore is the idea of doing small amounts of work each day. Often I find myself commiting to one class, and decide on finishing all the work of that class that day. Person to person, this stratagy tends to work for me. Most of the work is done in class, and all thats left is the homework. Likewise ive tried this stratagy in online courses, only to fail misarably.This article suggested instead to do small bits of work each day.My issue is that I treat a project like a gigantic task and get discouraged; this article suggest it be treated as a serier of smaller tasks to be delt with one at a time.The second tip is to plan out the day. This will make me less aimless when I do schoolwork.</p>

	<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/tips-for-overcoming-procrastination-2795714">Another article I found</a></li>

	<p>My biggest issue is procrastination. This article provides tips for combating procrastination. It explains the signs of onset procrastination, For example if I tell myself, "I can do this later." Thats a problem, and means I have to refos on my task. It also warns that procrastination is often brought about by fear.Fear of failure, or even succsess. For me its failure, and facing that fear is an important step in my time management.</p>
